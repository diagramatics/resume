# My Résumé

This is, literally, an online résumé. An HTML, directly printable, responsive résumé of a previous version I typed and styled in Microsoft Word.

Oh, and by the way, [do hire me](mailto:ohai@diagramatics.me)!

## HTML?

This résumé is made using HTML, CSS with Sass as the preprocessor and Autoprefixer to handle the pesky vendor prefixes, and slight JavaScript for more interaction.

## Printable?

Of course everything is printable, but this résumé

## Responsive

Unlike normal Word-made résumés, this resume is responsive so it can be printed on any paper size you can think of. The CSS `page-break-inside` helps with this a lot to prevent any page breaks between the content of each sections. The sizes of the typography is also tweaked to ensure everything fits at least in an A4 paper without any unordinary page breaks, leaving big empty gaps on the paper.
